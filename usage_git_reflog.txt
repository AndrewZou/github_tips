Case:
I commit the recent change into the repo for a reason by making detached HEAD. My coworker was not able to see these changes.
We run command to figure out what is the original source code that was checked in.
Command: git reflog
e63d5e5 (HEAD -> trader-ui-strategy, origin/trader-ui-strategy) HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from trader-ui-strategy to e63d5e5
e63d5e5 (HEAD -> trader-ui-strategy, origin/trader-ui-strategy) HEAD@{4}: pull origin trader-ui-strategy: Fast-forward
45f18f4 HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from ae5294e7b1f672631087b660b70368d5bba4f8ed to trader-ui-strategy
ae5294e HEAD@{6}: commit: Check in code for Corey to play for AG Grid data render issue

Luckly, we are able to see the HEAD: ae5294e7b1f672631087b660b70368d5bba4f8ed from the latest checkout.
So, we checkout the detached HEAD branch, with command,

git checkout ae5294e7b1f672631087b660b70368d5bba4f8ed
/////////////Screen Printout///////////////////////////////////
Note: switching to 'ae5294e7b1f672631087b660b70368d5bba4f8ed'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at ae5294e Check in code for Corey to play for AG Grid data render issue
/////////////End Screen Printout//////////////////////////////////////////////

Then, we are trying to merge this branch with my working branch.
First, switch to my working branch by running command: git checkout trader-ui-strategy
Second, merge this working branch with the detached branch code by running command with the HEAD hash: git merge ae5294e7b1f672631087b660b70368d5bba4f8ed

Finally, we got push these merged code to the official repo.
